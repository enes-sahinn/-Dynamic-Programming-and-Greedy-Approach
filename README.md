## About The Project
This project aims to select lions to maximize ‘total hunting ability’ with the given criteria by using dynamic programming method and greedy approach.

## Scenario of the Project
A large family of lions is preparing for a hunt. Each lion in the family has hunting ability and this ability is scored between 0 and 100. In addition, this family has a criterion for those who will be chosen to go hunting; “No lion can go hunting with his/her immediate parent”. The reason for this is to ensure that there will be a lion (s) who will stay at home to protect their house. Lions will be selected so that the ‘total hunting ability’ should be maximum.\
Two criteria:\
1- No lion can go hunting with his/her immediate parent\
2- Provide maximum ‘‘total hunting ability’ for the selected lion group

The information of hierarchy of lions and hunting abilities are given in text files. The algorithm reads them and saves in tree that has a left-child, right-sibling representation. 

Left-Child, Right-Sibling Representation: Each node holds pointers of parent, left-child, right-sibling.

## Information About Algorithms

In order to summarize the approaches, dynamic programming is a computer technique like “divide-and-conquer”. 
It solves problems by combining the solutions of sub-problems and it used for optimization problems. 
The greedy algorithm makes the choice that looks best at the moment. It makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution. Also greedy algorithm don’t always yield an optimal solution but sometime they do.
